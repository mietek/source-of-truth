abstract: |
  <p>The Curry-Howard isomorphism converting intuitionistic proofs into typed λ-terms is a simple instance of an internalization property of a system λ<sup>∞</sup> which unifies intuitionistic logic with λ-calculus and which is capable of internalizing its own derivations as λ-terms. We establish confluence and strong normalization of λ<sup>∞</sup>. The system λ<sup>∞</sup> considerably extends the expressive power of each of its major components: typed λ-calculus, intuitionistic and modal logic. It may be regarded as the pure λ version of the Logic of Proofs LP from [1, 2, 3]. In particular, the standard model of <b>t : F</b> in λ<sup>∞</sup> is “<b>t</b> is a proof of <b>F</b>”.</p>
