abstract: |
  Positive recursive (fixpoint) types can be added to the polymorphic (Church-style) lambda calculus **λ2** (System **F**) in several different ways, depending on the choice of the elimination operator. Known extensions of **λ2** fall into two equivalence classes with respect to mutual interpretability by means of beta-eta reductions, and elimination operators for fixpoint types can be classified accordingly as either “iterators” or “recursors”. Systems with iterators can be defined within **λ2** by means of beta reductions, and it is conjectured that systems with recursors cannot.
  In this paper we define the general form of mutual iteration scheme in **λ2** and we show that the explicit solution for particular functions defines recursors within **λ2**, though proof of this fact requires much more than beta reductions, namely parametricity. We propose a convenient _equational_ inference rule which can be used instead of parametricity for proving equational properties of polymorphic functions, defined by iterators.
