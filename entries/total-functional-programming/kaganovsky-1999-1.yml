title: Computing with exact real numbers in a radix-r system

abstract: |
  This paper investigates an arithmetic based upon the representation of computable exact real numbers by lazy infinite sequences of signed digits in a positional radix-_r_ system. We discuss advantages and problems associated with this representation, and develop well-behaved algorithms for a comprehensive range of numeric operations, including the four basic operations of arithmetic.
