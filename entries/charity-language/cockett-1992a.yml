  Equational logics are very good at handling algebraic theories. However, in programming languages which have branch instructions this sort of logic is ultimately inadequate. A branch instruction is a map to a coproduct and the problem with equational logics is that they cannot handle coproduct types.
  This paper introduces an equational style logic which incorporates the coproduct as a fundamental component. It is proven that the logic corresponds to distributive categories, that is categories with a final object, finite products, and coproducts, in which the product distributes over the coproduct.
