  <p>An endofunctor of a cartesian closed category is often called strong if it is enriched over the exponential. Equivalently this strength can be provided as a natural transformation <b>θ<sub>A;X</sub> : F(A)×X ⟶ F(A×X)</b> satisfying some elementary coherence conditions. This latter formulation does not require exponentials, relies only on the presence of an X-action over an X-strong category, and thereby provides a first-order viewpoint of strength.</p>
  <p>The 2-category of X-strong categories is not finitely complete. It particularly lacks many standard constructions including the Eilenberg-Moore construction. Thankfully, the suggestion — attributed to Plotkin by Moggi — that strength can also be equivalently framed in terms of fibrations using projections to X-objects as display maps can be fully realized. The equivalence can be portrayed as an embedding of X-strong categories into the 2-category of X-indexed categories or split fibrations over X. This embedding can be used to give a coherent declarative implementation of parametrized datatypes-with-strength and their constructors/destructors in the style of Hagino.</p>
  <p>The initiality and finality conditions associated with the strong datatype construction in the split fibration setting generate a strongly normalizing weak-head categorical combinator reduction system. The reduction rules permit both “eager” usage of initial datatypes and “lazy” usage of final datatypes to achieve reasonable computing strength. An X-action over a strong datatype can be computed in terms of programmed state transformations over its component datatypes. These reduction rules form the abstract engine for computation within the Charity categorical programming system.</p>
