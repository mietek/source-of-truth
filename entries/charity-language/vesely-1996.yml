title: Categorical combinators for Charity
author: Peter Vesely
year: 1996
collection: Charity language
abstract: |
  A 2-categorical notion of _parametric combinator_ is introduced. These combinators are operations for constructing arrows in a category and satisfy a 2-categorical abstraction of parametricity for strictly covariant functors. Inductive and co-inductive datatypes are compatible with these combinators and their universal properties are closely related to parametricity. The Charity programming language is based on _strong datatypes_ which are a specialization of 2-categorical datatypes. _Strong combinators_ (which are an appropriate specialization of 2-categorical combinators) provide a model of polymorphic functions in Charity.
