abstract: |
  <p>This thesis describes a series of three abstract machines, with associated compilation procedures, for the Charity programming language. Each machine is a refinement of the previous, getting closer to the level of the physical machine.</p>
  <p>The current C implementation of Charity is based on the last of these machines and is roughly twenty times faster than the original SML implementation, which was based on the first.</p>
