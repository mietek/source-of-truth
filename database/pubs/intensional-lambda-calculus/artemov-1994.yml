abstract: |
  <p>In this paper individual proofs are integrated into provability logic. Systems of axioms for a logic with operators “<b>A</b> is provable” and “<b>p is a proof of <b>A</b>” are introduced, provided with Kripke semantics and decision procedure. Completeness theorems with respect to the arithmetical interpretation are proved.</p>
