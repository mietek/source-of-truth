  <p>Answers to two old questions are given in this paper.</p>
  <p>1. Modal logic S4, which was informally specified by Gödel in 1933 as a logic for provability, meets its exact provability interpretation.</p>
  <p>2. Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov realizing operations (1931-32) for intuitionistic logic Int also get exact interpretation as corresponding propositional operations on proofs; both S4 and Int turn out to be complete with respect to this proof realization</p>
  <p>These results are based on operational reading of S4, where a modality is split into three operations. The <i>logic of proofs</i> with these operations is shown to be arithmetically complete with respect to the intended provability semantics and sufficient to realize every operation on proofs admitting propositional specification in arithmetic.</p>
