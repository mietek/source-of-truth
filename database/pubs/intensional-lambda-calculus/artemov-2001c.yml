title: Unified semantics for modality and λ-terms via proof polynomials

abstract: |
  <p>It is shown that the modal logic S4, simple λ-calculus and modal λ-calculus admit a realization in a very simple propositional logical system LP, which has an exact provability semantics. In LP both modality and λ-terms become objects of the same nature, namely, proof polynomials. The provability interpretation of modal λ-terms presented here may be regarded as a system-independent generalization of the Curry-Howard isomorphism of proofs and λ-terms.</p>
