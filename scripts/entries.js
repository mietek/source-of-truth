    "abstract": "Positive recursive (fixpoint) types can be added to the polymorphic (Church-style) lambda calculus **λ2** (System **F**) in several different ways, depending on the choice of the elimination operator. We compare several such definitions and we show that they fall into two equivalence classes with respect to mutual interpretability by means of beta-eta reductions. Elimination operators for fixpoint types are thus classified as either “iterators” or “recursors”. This classification has an interpretation in terms of the Curry-Howard correspondence: types of iterators and recursors can be seen as images of induction axioms under different dependency-erasing maps. Systems with recursors are beta-eta equivalent to a calculus **λ2U** of recursive types with the operators **Fold** : _σ[μα.σ/α] → μα.σ_ and **Unfold** : _μα.σ → σ[μα.σ/α]_, where the composition **Unfold** ◦ **Fold** reduces to identity.\nIt is known that systems with iterators can be defined within **λ2**, by means of beta reductions. We conjecture that systems with recursors can not. In this paper we show that the system **λ2U** does not have such a property. For this we study the notion of polymorphic type embeddability (via (beta) left-invertible terms) and we show that if a type _σ_ is embedded into another type _τ_ then _τ_ must be of depth at least equal to the depth of _σ_.\n",

Systems with iterators can be defined within **λ2** by means of beta reductions, and it is conjectured that systems with recursors cannot.\nIn this paper we define the general form of mutual iteration scheme in **λ2** and we show that the explicit solution for particular functions defines recursors within **λ2**, though proof of this fact requires much more than beta reductions, namely parametricity. We propose a convenient _equational_ inference rule which can be used instead of parametricity for proving equational properties of polymorphic functions, defined by iterators.\n",

    "abstract": "This thesis presents a framework which allows one to perform infinite precision numerical computations using an arithmetic based upon the representation of computable numbers by lazy infinite sequences of digits in a redundant positional radix system. We discuss advantages and problems associated with this representation, and develop well-behaved algorithms for a comprehensive range of numeric operations, including the four basic operations of arithmetic, and a number of important elementary functions. We investigate the system of real numbers represented in an arbitrary radix _r_, and then show that the radix-_r_ algorithms also lend themselves with little modification to the unified representation of complex numbers in an imaginary radix, which significantly speeds up exact complex number manipulations. A full complexity analysis is given, which suggests that notwithstanding an earlier claim, positional number system representations can lead to efficient implementations of constructive arithmetic, and in particular, our algorithms largely overcome what has been known as the granularity effect. The algorithms have been implemented both in the functional programming language Miranda and imperative language C, and guidelines have been provided for optimizing and improving the existing implementations.\n",

To be useful, ESFP should include structures such as streams which can be computationally unwound infinitely often. We describe a syntactic analysis to ensure that infinitely proceeding structures, which we shall term _codata_, are productive. This analysis is an extension of the check for _guardedness_ that has been used with definitions over coinductive types in Martin-Löf’s type theory and in the calculus of constructions. Our analysis is presented as a form of abstract interpretation that allows a wider syntactic class of corecursive definitions to be recognised as productive than in previous work. Thus programmers will have fewer restrictions on their use of infinite streams within a strongly normalizing functional language.\n",

A key feature of the discipline is that we introduce a type distinction between _data_ which is known to be finite, and _codata_ which is (potentially) infinite. To ensure termination, recursion over data must be well-founded, and corecursion (the definition schema for codata) must be productive, and both of these restrictions must be enforced automatically by the compiler. In our previous work we used abstract interpretation to establish the productivity of corecursive definitions in an elementary strong functional language. We show here that similar ideas can be applied in the dual case to check whether recursive function definitions are strongly normalising. We thus exhibit a powerful termination analysis technique which we demonstrate can be extended to partial functions.\n",

    "abstract": "The driving idea of functional programming is to make programming more closely related to mathematics. A program in a functional language such as Haskell or Miranda consists of equations which are both computation rules and a basis for simple algebraic reasoning about the functions and data structures they define. The existing model of functional programming, although elegant and powerful, is compromised to a greater extent than is commonly recognised by the presence of partial functions. We consider a simple discipline of total functional programming designed to exclude the possibility of non-termination. Among other things this requires a type distinction between data, which is finite, and codata, which is potentially infinite.\n",
